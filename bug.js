```javascript
// ... other Tailwind directives ...

.my-class {
  @apply text-red-500;
}

.my-other-class {
  @apply bg-gray-200 p-4;  /* Error here! */
}
```
The `@apply` directive is used incorrectly.  In this example, it's applied to multiple classes separated by a space in `.my-other-class`.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the utility classes conflict.  Tailwind's `@apply` directive is designed to apply a single utility class at a time.

# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with multiple utility classes separated by spaces. This can lead to unexpected or erroneous behavior.

## Bug Description
The `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS is intended to apply a single utility class. Attempting to apply multiple classes separated by spaces within a single `@apply` directive can cause conflicts and unexpected results. 

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Observe the `bug.js` file, which shows incorrect usage of the `@apply` directive.
3. Observe how the resulting styles might behave unexpectedly in a browser.

## Solution
The solution is to apply each utility class individually using separate `@apply` directives or by directly writing the utility classes without `@apply`. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.

## Additional Notes
This demonstrates a subtle but important point in how Tailwind's `@apply` directive functions. It is important to understand its limitations to ensure proper functionality.
